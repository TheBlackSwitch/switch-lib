# 📝Pack Description:
This is a library datapack which contains code that is included in almost all my datapacks!
It's located under the namespace ``theblackswitch`` and contains code that would otherwise 
conflict with my other packs since it would be installed multiple times.

# ⭐What this pack adds:

- Movement predicates (forward, backward, jump, sneak...)
- A player ID system
- A slowtick system
- A player specific storage
- A temp score for temp values
- A server data score for server data
- An overlay plugin used to show overlays to the user (using equipment)
- A tag you can add to your custom data of an item to kill it when dropped
- A lightweight easing api used to ease between 2 positions easily. Useful for cutscenes!
- A random predicate to run stuff with a random chance
- A newtonian approximation algorithm for a square root

# 🖥️For developers:

## using the features
  For performance reasons these features aren't enabled by default. You can enable them by setting their id in the storage ``theblackswitch:modules`` to true.
  The general path looks something like this: ``theblackswitch:modules <library_version_name>.<feature>``

## Vscode snippets:
  I've added **vscode snippets** for almost **all** the **features** so you can for example, easily import a motion check predicate in your code.
  You'll find them in the ``.vscode`` folder in this repo
